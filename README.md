![Cover Image](API.jpg)

Welcome to my API and Chatbot Skills Practice Repository! This repository is designed to showcase my progress and skills in working with various APIs and chatbots. It's part of my journey to become a proficient data analyst and chatbot developer.

## Overview

This repository is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate my interactions with different APIs and chatbots. These notebooks illustrate data retrieval, data analysis, and chatbot responses. Each notebook focuses on a specific API or chatbot project, allowing me to explore various data sources and language models.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `notebooks/`: This directory contains Jupyter Notebooks for various API and chatbot projects.
- `data/`: A folder for storing retrieved or processed data.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python libraries and dependencies necessary for the projects.

## Note

This project serves educational purposes and showcases my progress in mastering API-related tasks and chatbot interactions. The data used here is sourced from publicly available APIs, and the code serves as a learning tool.

## Contact

If you have any questions, suggestions, or would like to discuss data analysis, chatbots, or APIs, feel free to reach out to me at @jmorenoiriarte@gmail.com.

## Acknowledgments

I'd like to acknowledge the online resources, tutorials, and open-source community for contributing to my learning journey. Special thanks to OpenAI for providing valuable language models.

Join me in exploring the world of APIs and chatbots!
