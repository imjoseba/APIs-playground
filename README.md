# API Skills Practice Project

![Cover Image](rick-morty.jpg)

Welcome to my API skills practice project repository! This project is designed to help me enhance my skills in working with various APIs and data retrieval. It's part of my journey to become a proficient data analyst.

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate how to interact with different APIs, retrieve data, and perform various data analysis tasks. Each notebook is dedicated to a specific API or project, allowing me to explore different data sources and develop my API skills.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `notebooks/`: This directory contains Jupyter Notebooks for various API projects.
- `data/`: A folder where I store any retrieved or processed data.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python libraries and dependencies required for the projects.

## Note

This project is intended for educational purposes and to demonstrate my progress in mastering API-related tasks. The data used here is sourced from publicly available APIs, and the code serves as a learning tool.

## Contact

If you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to connect and discuss data analysis and APIs, feel free to reach out to me at @jmorenoiriarte@gmail.com.

## Acknowledgments

I'd like to acknowledge the online resources and tutorials that have contributed to my learning journey. Special thanks to the open-source community for providing valuable APIs and datasets.

Enjoy exploring the world of APIs with me!
